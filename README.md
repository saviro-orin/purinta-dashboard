## Why this exists

I want to build web apps using [Phoenix][phoenix]. [LiveView][liveview] is great, but I'm familiar with and prefer the rich [React][react] ecosystem.
In the past, I would have reached for a frontend framework (e.g. Next.js), with an Elixir backend API. This has numerous downsides, including
having to manage and sync deployments, migrations, versions, additional infrastructure etc. all of which compound complexity exponentially. [Inertia.js][inertia] provides a way of acting as the glue between Phoenix and React (or Vue or Svelte), so you don't have to deal with the complexities of separate repos.

This template project serves as a starting point for a lot of my web applications, so that I don't have to duplicate a lot of the setup work. It's fully featured (see [Features](#features) below). Feel free to use it however you want or submit a PR if you find some way of improving it.

It's provided as-is, with no guarantees or warranties of any kind — use it at your own risk.

## Features

- **Authentication** — email + password with link-based confirmation and password reset, [Argon2][argon2] hashing, sliding sessions, account management, and no email enumeration.
- **Real-time** — token-authenticated [Phoenix Channels][channels] with React hooks that survive [Inertia][inertia] navigation.
- **Internationalization** — [gettext][gettext] on the server and [react-i18next][react-i18next] on the client; English + Spanish with locale detection.
- **Theming** — light / dark / system with no flash of the wrong theme.
- **Accessibility** — [Radix UI][radix] primitives, [Biome][biome] a11y linting in CI, and [axe-core][axe] auditing in dev.
- **Email** — [Swoosh][swoosh] (HTML + text) via [Mailjet][mailjet] in production, with an in-browser mailbox in dev.
- **Security** — rate-limited auth endpoints, Secure cookies, CSRF protection, and HTTPS/HSTS in production.
- **Background jobs** — [Oban][oban], configured and ready.
- **Testing** — [ExUnit][exunit] with a coverage gate, [ex_machina][exmachina] factories, and a [Playwright][playwright] E2E suite.
- **Tooling & CI** — [mise][mise]-pinned toolchain, [Biome][biome] / [Credo][credo] / [Dialyzer][dialyxir], and [GitHub Actions][gha].
- **Deployment** — multi-stage [Docker][docker] release with server-side rendering.
- **Documentation** — [ex_doc][exdoc] guides and module reference.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** [mise][mise] (pins the toolchain) and a running [PostgreSQL][postgresql].

> **Starting a new project from this template?** Rename it to your own name first:
>
> ```bash
> scripts/rename_project.sh YourAppName   # PascalCase
> ```
>
> It rewrites every module, the OTP app name, file/directory paths, and configs
> (both `PascalCase` and `snake_case` forms), then rebuilds and runs `mix precommit`
> to verify. Use `--dry-run` to preview the changes first.

```bash
# 1. Install the pinned Erlang, Elixir, and Node (versions live in mise.toml)
mise trust && mise install

# 2. Install deps, create + migrate the database, build assets
mix setup

# 3. Start the server
mix phx.server   # or: iex -S mix phx.server
```

Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000). With shell activation enabled
(`eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` in `~/.zshrc`), mise switches to the project's
toolchain automatically when you `cd` in.

## Testing

```bash
mix test                       # unit + integration, with coverage gate (mix test --cover)
mix precommit                  # format, credo, biome, i18n, tests — run before every commit
npm --prefix assets run e2e    # Playwright E2E (needs a running server; see the guide)
```

See the [End-to-End Testing guide](docs/e2e-testing.md) for the [Playwright][playwright] setup.

## Documentation

Searchable developer guides and the full module reference are generated with [ex_doc][exdoc]:

```bash
mix docs
```

In development they're also served at
[`/dev/docs`](http://localhost:4000/dev/docs/index.html). Topic guides live in
`docs/` — e.g. the [End-to-End Testing guide](docs/e2e-testing.md).

## Deployment

`SECRET_KEY_BASE` must be generated **once** and kept stable across restarts — a
changing value invalidates every session and signed cookie. Generate it a single
time with `mix phx.gen.secret` and store it in your secrets manager or host config,
then build and run the release image (reading the stored values from the environment):

```bash
docker build -t purinta_dashboard .
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/DB" \
  -e MAILJET_API_KEY="$MAILJET_API_KEY" \
  -e MAILJET_SECRET="$MAILJET_SECRET" \
  -e PHX_HOST="example.com" \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="$SECRET_KEY_BASE" \
  purinta_dashboard
```

`config/runtime.exs` requires `DATABASE_URL`, `MAILJET_API_KEY`, `MAILJET_SECRET`,
and `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and will refuse to boot without them. `PHX_HOST` defaults to
`example.com` but should always be set in production (it's used for absolute URLs
in emails). `PORT` (default `4000`), `POOL_SIZE`, `ECTO_IPV6`, and
`DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY` are optional.

Database migrations run via the release: `bin/migrate`. See Phoenix's
[deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html) for hosting specifics.

### Liveness probe

`GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` — cheap, no database calls, no external
lookups. The image's `HEALTHCHECK` polls it via the embedded Node binary, and
it's a sensible target for Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes too.

### Bumping Erlang / Elixir / Node

Runtime versions are pinned in **two** places that must agree: `mise.toml` (dev
and CI toolchain, via [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)) and the `ARG` declarations
at the top of the `Dockerfile` (release build). `mix precommit` runs
`scripts/check-tool-versions.sh` as its first step and will fail if those drift —
so when bumping a runtime version, update both files in the same commit.

## Conventions

Project architecture, invariants, and coding conventions are documented in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — start there before making changes.
